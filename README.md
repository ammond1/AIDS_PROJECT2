REDDIT_SECRET=your_reddit_client_secret
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

## üñ•Ô∏è Setting up Firebase Hosting and Realtime Database

1. Install Firebase CLI:

   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. Login to Firebase:

   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. Initialize Firebase in the project directory:

   ```bash
   firebase init
   ```

   - Select **Hosting** and **Database**.
   - Set `public/` as your hosting directory.
   - Configure as a single-page app if needed (yes).
   - Set up your Firebase Realtime Database rules and URL.

4. Set up `public/` frontend to read data from your Realtime Database (make sure your `index.html` includes Firebase SDK and database references).

Example snippet in your `index.html`:

```html
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.0.0/firebase-app.js"></script>
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.0.0/firebase-database.js"></script>
<script>
  const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "YOUR_DATABASE_URL",
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
    appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
  };

  const app = firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
  const db = firebase.database();

  db.ref('summaries/').on('value', (snapshot) => {
    const data = snapshot.val();
    // Display data on your page
  });
</script>
```

## üß† Running the Backend

Run the Python script to scrape and summarize Reddit posts and upload them to Firebase:

```bash
python main.py
```

This script will:
- Connect to Reddit
- Fetch posts based on keywords
- Summarize the posts using OpenAI
- Upload the results to your Firebase Realtime Database under `summaries/`

Make sure your service account JSON and database URL are correctly referenced.

## üåê Hosting the Frontend

Deploy the frontend to Firebase Hosting:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

After deploying, you can access the app at the provided Firebase Hosting URL.
